# raygui for cmake

This is a thin wrapper for raygui to support cmake building.

There is no modification on raygui source code.

## Building raygui as library

In src directory, I provide raygui.c and raygui.h which has **same** contents.
Because I need compiler be recoginze original raygui.h as source file.
